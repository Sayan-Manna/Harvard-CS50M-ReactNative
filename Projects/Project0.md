# Project 0: TODO App

## Objectives

* Become more comfortable with JS and DOM manipulation.
* Gain experience reading and adding to source code.

## Getting Started

Download the distro code for your first game from [https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2018/spring/projects/0/project0.zip](https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2018/spring/projects/0/project0.zip) and unzip `project0.zip`, which should yield a directory called project0.

Then, in a terminal window (located in `/Applications/Utilities` on Mac or by typing `cmd` in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted `project0` (recall that the `cd` command can change your current directory), and run

```sh
cd project0
```

To get started, follow the directions in your project README.

## FAQs

* Will I be penalized for editing files other than `script.js`?
  * Nope, feel free to edit the HTML or CSS if you feel like it adds to your app!
* Do I have to worry about browser compatibility?
  * Not at all. As long as your app works on Chrome (or any other browser that you specify), that’s all we’ll be using to test your app.
* Can I use an external library?
  * Please stick to just vanilla JS for this project.

## How to Submit

1. Visit [cs50.me](https://cs50.me/), log in with your GitHub account, and click **Authorize submit50**. You should receive two emails from GitHub inviting you to join CS50’s “organizations” on GitHub. Click the button in those emails to accept both of the invitations.
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and, optionally, [install `submit50`](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/submit50/).
3. Using Git, push your work to `https://github.com/submit50/USERNAME.git`, where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, on a branch called `cs50/mobile/2018/x/projects/0` or, if you’ve installed `submit50`, execute

    ```sh
    submit50 cs50/mobile/2018/x/projects/0
    ```

    instead.

4. [Record a 1- to 5-minute screencast](https://www.howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen/) in which you demonstrate your app’s functionality and/or walk viewers through your code. [Upload that video to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/upload) (as unlisted or public, but not private) or somewhere else.
